README

This demo replicates my problem with `suwsgi` - backend node closes suwsgi
connection without any apparent reason.

Usage
=====

Run FastRouter with `suwsgi` backend: ::

   uwsgi --ini demo.ini


Testing
=======
::
   $ curl http://localhost:10000
   curl: (52) Empty reply from server


Extras
======

Alternatively, use simplified configuration (without FastRouter and subscription server): ::

   uwsgi --ini demo-no-subscription-server.ini
